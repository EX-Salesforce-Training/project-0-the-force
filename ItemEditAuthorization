//This particular trigger is designed to block any editing of the Stored Item type of records unless the 'Edit Info Authorized' 
// checkbox is checked. I want the records to be editable by lower level members of the team so that mgmt don't have to 
// be responsible for every single note about a type of item, but I want to effectively be able to lock records from editing
// if that account team designates this as necessary -> so I don't want to simple restrict access to the account
